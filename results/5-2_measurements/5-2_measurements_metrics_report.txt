BENCHMARK QUALITY BY STUDY ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------
Studies with benchmark quality information: 77
Studies without benchmark quality information: 1

Benchmark quality aggregation logic per study:
  - High quality: if study has at least one measurement with high quality benchmark
  - Low quality: if study has at least one low quality benchmark but no high quality
  - No benchmark: if study has no benchmarks (all measurements marked as 'no benchmark')

Aggregated benchmark quality distribution by study:
  No benchmark: 33 studies (42.9%)
  Low quality: 27 studies (35.1%)
  High quality: 17 studies (22.1%)

Raw benchmark quality distribution by measurements:
  l: 78 measurements (45.9%)
  no benchmark: 67 measurements (39.4%)
  h: 25 measurements (14.7%)

PERFORMANCE VS BENCHMARK BY QUALITY GROUP
------------------------------------------
Performance aggregation logic per study:
  - For high quality group: select measurements with high quality benchmarks, show best performance
  - For low quality group: select measurements with low quality benchmarks, show best performance
  - Performance ranking: better > similar > worse

HIGH QUALITY BENCHMARKS GROUP:
Studies in high quality group: 17
Studies with performance data: 16
Performance distribution:
  worse than benchmark: 9 studies (52.9%)
  better than benchmark: 5 studies (29.4%)
  similar than benchmark: 2 studies (11.8%)

LOW QUALITY BENCHMARKS GROUP:
Studies in low quality group: 27
Studies with performance data: 27
Performance distribution:
  better than benchmark: 23 studies (85.2%)
  worse than benchmark: 3 studies (11.1%)
  similar than benchmark: 1 studies (3.7%)
