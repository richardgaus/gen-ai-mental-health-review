  Sample Size: 12

APPLICATION DETAILS:
  Application Subtype (Client-Facing): Multi-turn chatbot
  Intervention Type: Informal counseling (e.g., emotional support conversation)
  Intended Intervention Type: Non-specific support
  Models Employed: GPT-3.5 family

  • Metric 2: n (vs benchmark: nan)
  • Metric 3: n (vs benchmark: nan)

SAFETY & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
  • Risk Detection: Yes - n contrast, the intervention group consisted of seven
patients who participated in 3 to 6 semi-structured sessions
with ChatGPT (version 3.5) each, under the facilitation of
their attending psychiatrist

attending psychiatrist was checking responses
  • Privacy Awareness: Yes - Another concern with chatbots is the potential misuse of
personal data shared.10 As these chatbots collect and store
data about a user’s mental health and emotional state, the
risk of unauthorized access to this information is not triv-
ial.11 Such breaches could lead to serious repercussions, in-
cluding discrimination based on the user’s mental health
status. Therefore, user privacy and security must be a top
concern, requiring secure data storage and transmission,
along with adherence to relevant data protection regula-
tions.

GENERAL NOTES:
  intervention group did not use chatgbt, but rather discussed the chatgbt answers with their therapists--> potential, to distort outcomes

PARTICIPANT INFORMATION:
  Client Type: General population
  Sample Size: 68

VALIDATION & CONTROL:
  Validated Outcomes: y
  Validated Outcomes Notes: unclear: Each group’s progress was measured by two questionnaires one of which evaluated the test taker’s relationship with their thoughts, and the other estimated their
level of cognitive distortions. These assessments were conducted three times: twice
before the intervention itself and once after the experiment was over. After that, the
gathered data was analyzed using the statistical software JASP.

AAQ, CDS are actually validated clinical measures
  Control Condition: y
  Control Condition Notes: After the recruitment was done,
participants were randomly divided into two groups: control and experimental. The
experimental group received intervention in the form of interaction with TeaBot and
was asked to use a manual for learning more about the therapeutic approach used. The
control group received no intervention with only a manual available to learn more about
distortions.

  • Risk Detection: Yes - The SAD state submodule contains several ML models, including DT, BagDT, BoostDT, RF, CNB, kNN, MLP, LOG, 
and SVM (see Section Machine Learning Algorithms). They are trained to detect and forecast SAD levels and symptoms, 
described in Table 3, including the following: levels of stress, anxiety, depression; and symptoms of inability to relax, 
nervousness, fear, tightness in chest, lightheadedness, feeling hot or cold, trembling, pounding heart, sadness, self-hatred, 
anhedonia, hopelessness, indecisiveness, fatigue, emotional detachment, and suicidality. The submodule keeps track of 
the users’ mental health. It informs how the system should act in its support of the user, and whether strategy dispatch is 
necessary.
  • Content Safety: Yes - Language generation humanizer decides whether the added text generated in the previous module is acceptable in 
terms of risk for the user. It rejects the text if it is detected as risky.

  Validated Outcomes: y
  Validated Outcomes Notes: Reliable improvement refers to a clinically significant
improvement in symptoms following a course of treatment and
is calculated as the score difference between the first and the
last validated clinical questionnaire completed. The types of
questionnaires patients complete are tailored to their specific
condition. For example, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9) [30] is used to measure depression symptom severity,
and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) [31] is used
to measure anxiety symptom severity. A clinically significant
improvement in symptoms is considered a change score ≥6 for
PHQ-9 or ≥4 for GAD-7 [26]
