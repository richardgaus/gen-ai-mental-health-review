The reflections used came from a variety of sources: from previous versions of this chatbot that were deemed to be acceptable MI reflections by MI-literate researchers or actual reflections produced by MI-literate researchers or MI-expert clinicians.

To address the rate of poor reflections, we developed version 2 of the generator with 2 significant enhancements. First, a larger set of 301 fine-tuning triplets were collected over approximately 10 months of deploying the chatbot, making use of the various responses from smokers who had been recruited in a similar manner, as described in the Participant Recruitment and Screening subsection. This second data set did not include any of the data from the earlier chatbot version [40,41]. Only MI-consistent reflections were used, which were sourced from MI clinicians, MI-literate researchers, or version 1 of the generator. The labeling and selection of the MI-consistent reflections were improved by using multiple human raters and a carefully controlled decision tree to determine the validity of the reflections. The new rating scheme itself was stricter than the one used in version 1, which caused the hit rate to go down—not because the generation was worse but because of the stricter rating. The hit rate of the new generator was measured to be 55.1% (166/301) on a set of reflections.",Motivational interviewing reflections,English,Yes,No,Psychopathology,Trained professionals,A Motivational Interviewing Chatbot With Generative Reflections for Increasing Readiness to Quit Smoking: Iterative Development Study,1,22,Other

 This dataset contains hypothetical and real-world situations, thoughts and emotional processes reported by crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We manually curate 180 pairs of diverse situations with negative thoughts from this dataset.
 Mental Health America (MHA). Situations and thoughts from crowdworkers may not reflect the broad range of mental health challenges that people face in real-life. To incorporate more real-world situations and thoughts, we ran a survey on the MHA website (screening.mhanational.org). MHA visitors (who typically use the website for screening of mental illnesses) were asked to describe any negative thoughts and the associated situations they were struggling with. We manually curate 120 pairs of self-reported situations and thoughts to ensure broad coverage of relevant topics based on high diversity and manual filtering.

dataset_3,External data set,"training: 2.85 GB psychology corpus data crawled from psychology platforms like Yinxinli and Tianya (they crawled this data themselves). Description: The second dataset was obtained by crawling various Chinese social media platforms, such as Tianya, Zhihu, and Yixinli. These platforms allow users to post topics or questions about mental and emotional issues, while other users can offer support and assistance to help-seeking individuals. The Yixinli website specifically focuses on professional mental health support, but only provides approximately 10,000 samples. Other types of datasets collected from these platforms included articles and conversations, which we converted into a question-and-answer format. However, we excluded the articles from our fine- tuning training due to the model’s input limitations and the fact that our predictions focused on mental health support answers. The articles were often lengthy, and many of them were in PDF format, requiring additional time for conversion into a usable text format. Consequently, we only obtained around 5000 article samples. In order to address the lack of emotional expression in the text of these articles, we incorporated text data from oral expressions. We crawled audio and video data from platforms like Qingting FM and Ximalaya, popular audio and video-sharing forums in China. However, converting audio and video data into text format was time-consuming, resulting in a limited amount of data in our dataset. We utilised the dataset obtained from websites for fine-tuning training. Ultimately, our entire dataset consisted of 400,000 samples, each separated by a blank line, i.e., “\n\ n”. Table 2 shows the time spent on data crawling from different websites. It is evident that most of the samples in this dataset were obtained from Tianya, resulting in a data size of approximately 2 GB. The datasets from Zhihu and Yixinli were 500 MB and 200 MB, respectively. Overall, we spent approximately 70 h on data collection.

therapy, anxiety, depression, and CPTSD. Initially, the
dataset comprised 3,000 data points, with a text column
serving as the input and a target column providing labeled
sentiment. Recognizing the importance of data volume
in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of machine
learning models, we expand the dataset (TABLE I) to encompass 12,221 data points
